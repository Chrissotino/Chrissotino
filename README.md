### About Me

I'm an AI Architect based in Switzerland, specializing in designing and implementing cutting-edge AI solutions for enterprise environments. My work sits at the intersection of intelligent automation, model-context protocol (MCP) architectures, and the Microsoft technology ecosystem.

I help organizations unlock the full potential of AI by building robust, scalable, and production-ready systems that integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise infrastructure.
